                    Beyond coding, you'll often find me immersed in the world of books. Reading has been my lifelong
                    companion, allowing me to explore new realms, gather knowledge, and escape into captivating stories.
                    Alongside reading, I also enjoy writing. Poetry is one of my creative outlets, and expressing
                    thoughts
                    and emotions through words brings me immense joy.

                    One of my favorite pastimes is stargazing. The vastness of the night sky, adorned with countless

                    fills me with wonder and introspection. I find solace in the tranquil beauty of the cosmos, and it
                    helps
                    me contemplate life's mysteries and the interconnectedness of everything.
